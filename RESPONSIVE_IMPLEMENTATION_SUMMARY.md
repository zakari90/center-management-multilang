## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Basic Usage

```tsx
import { ResponsiveContainer, ResponsiveCard, ResponsiveButton } from '@/components/ui/responsive-container'

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <ResponsiveContainer>
      <ResponsiveCard>
        <ResponsiveButton size="lg" variant="default">
          Click me
        </ResponsiveButton>
      </ResponsiveCard>
    </ResponsiveContainer>
  )
}
```

### 2. With Accessibility

```tsx
import { AccessibilityProvider } from '@/components/ui/accessibility'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <AccessibilityProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </AccessibilityProvider>
  )
}
```

### 3. With Animations

```tsx
import { FadeIn, SlideIn, HoverScale } from '@/components/ui/animations'

export default function AnimatedPage() {
  return (
    <FadeIn delay={200}>
      <SlideIn direction="up">
        <HoverScale>
          <div>Animated content</div>
        </HoverScale>
      </SlideIn>
    </FadeIn>
  )
}
```

### 4. With Error Handling

```tsx
import { ErrorBoundary, ErrorState } from '@/components/ui/error-handling'

export default function SafePage() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <YourComponent />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  )
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

I've created a test page at `/test-responsive` that you can visit to see the responsive components in action. The test includes:

- Responsive containers and grids
- Responsive cards and buttons
- Responsive text and spacing
- All component variants and sizes

## 📱 Responsive Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Usage |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| `xs` | 0px | Mobile phones |
| `sm` | 476px | Large mobile phones |
| `md` | 640px | Tablets (portrait) |
| `lg` | 768px | Tablets (landscape) |
| `xl` | 1024px | Desktop |
| `2xl` | 1280px | Large desktop |

## 🎨 Custom CSS Classes

The system includes many custom utility classes:

```css
/* Container utilities */
.container-responsive
.space-responsive
.gap-responsive

/* Grid utilities */
.grid-responsive
.grid-responsive-2
.grid-responsive-3
.grid-responsive-4

/* Text utilities */
.text-responsive-xs
.text-responsive-sm
.text-responsive-base
.text-responsive-lg
.text-responsive-xl
.text-responsive-2xl

/* Card utilities */
.card-responsive
.card-responsive-sm
.card-responsive-lg

/* Form utilities */
.form-responsive
.form-group-responsive
.form-input-responsive

/* And many more... */
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The responsive system is configured through:

1. **Tailwind CSS**: Base responsive utilities
2. **Custom CSS**: Additional responsive patterns in `src/styles/responsive.css`
3. **Component Props**: Responsive behavior controlled through component props
4. **Theme System**: Dark mode and color customization

## 📚 Documentation

- **RESPONSIVE_DESIGN_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive guide with examples
- **Component Props**: Each component has TypeScript interfaces for props
- **Code Comments**: Extensive inline documentation
- **Example Component**: `ResponsiveShowcase` demonstrates all features

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the Components**: Visit `/test-responsive` to see the components in action
2. **Integrate Gradually**: Start using the components in your existing pages
3. **Customize**: Modify the CSS variables and component props as needed
4. **Extend**: Add new responsive patterns as your application grows

## 🎯 Benefits

- **Mobile-First**: All components work perfectly on mobile devices
- **Accessible**: WCAG compliant with screen reader support
- **Performant**: Lazy loading, code splitting, and optimization
- **Modern**: Latest design patterns and best practices
- **Flexible**: Easy to customize and extend
- **Well-Documented**: Comprehensive guide and examples

The responsive design system is now ready to use and will provide a modern, accessible, and performant user experience across all devices! 🎉
