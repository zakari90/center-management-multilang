## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: User Creates Student While Offline

```
User fills form → Clicks Save
         ↓
apiClient detects: navigator.onLine = false
         ↓
Calls: addStudentOffline(data, userId)
         ↓
Stores in: IndexedDB → students table
         ↓
Queues in: syncQueue with operation: 'CREATE'
         ↓
Returns: Temp data with temp_* ID
         ↓
Shows: Toast "Saved offline - will sync when online"
         ↓
Redirects: To students list
         ↓
Display: Student appears in cached list ✅
         ↓
[Later when online]
         ↓
SyncProvider detects: navigator.onLine = true
         ↓
Triggers: syncWithServer()
         ↓
Uploads: All pending operations
         ↓
Server: Confirms with real ID
         ↓
Local: Updates with server ID
         ↓
Toast: "✓ All synced"
```

### Scenario 2: User Views Students While Offline

```
User navigates to: /manager/students
         ↓
Component calls: getStudents(managerId)
         ↓
apiClient tries: fetch /api/students
         ↓
Network fails
         ↓
Falls back to: getStudentsOffline(managerId)
         ↓
Queries: IndexedDB students table
         ↓
Returns: All cached students
         ↓
Display: Full list, search, export ✅
         ↓
Status: Shows "🔴 Offline" with pending count
         ↓
User can: Work with data normally
```

### Scenario 3: Automatic Sync on Reconnect

```
User goes online (toggles Network off → on in DevTools)
         ↓
Browser fires: 'online' event
         ↓
SyncProvider catches: handleOnline()
         ↓
Shows: Toast "Reconnected - syncing..."
         ↓
Status: Changes to "🔵 Checking for updates..."
         ↓
Calls: syncWithServer()
         ↓
Steps:
  1. Gets all pending operations from syncQueue
  2. For each operation:
     - Sends to appropriate API endpoint
     - Marks as 'syncing'
     - On success: Deletes from queue, updates local ID
     - On failure: Retries up to 5 times
  3. Updates IndexedDB with server data
         ↓
Result: Toast "✓ All synced", pending count → 0
```

## 🎓 Developer Guide for Future Updates

### Adding Offline Support to a New Form

**Before (❌ Old Way):**
```typescript
const handleSubmit = async () => {
  await fetch("/api/new-entity", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify(data)
  })
}
```

**After (✅ New Way):**
```typescript
import { apiPost, isAppOnline } from "@/lib/apiClient";
import { toast } from "sonner";

const handleSubmit = async () => {
  try {
    await apiPost("/api/new-entity", data, {
      offlineEntity: 'newEntities',
      offlineFallback: async () => {
        // Implement offline handler here
        return await addNewEntityOffline(data, userId);
      }
    });
    
    if (isAppOnline()) {
      toast.success("Created successfully");
    } else {
      toast.success("Saved offline - will sync when online");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error(error.message);
  }
}
```

### Adding Offline Read Support to a List Page

**Before (❌ Old Way):**
```typescript
const data = await fetch("/api/entities");
```

**After (✅ New Way):**
```typescript
import { getEntities } from "@/lib/apiClient";

const data = await getEntities(userId).catch(() => {
  // Automatically falls back to IndexedDB
  return getEntitiesOffline(userId);
});
```
